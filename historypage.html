        <p>According to the resident elders of the barangay, the short story started in a pitch dark place, umberland and has a kaingin part in the mountains of Sierra Madre. Based on the version of the first occupants that came from Infanta, Quezon and Nagcarlan Laguna, it started from few families and they cooperatively and unitedly cleaned and trimmed the place to cultivate and dwell into.<br><br>

According to the official list of the Office of the Congress on June 22, 1957, the original name of the barangay is Sitio Marugundong which is under Barangay Llavac, Infanta Quezon. By the power of Congressional Housebill 6211 Republic act 973, this is one of the portions of Sitio Biga of begy Llavac which was consist of Sitio Biga, Pandarawan, Bubuyog, Riao, Mahabang Salongan, Calauag, Tipuan, at Tulay Bato.<br><br>

By the power of Executive Order 410 of President Carlos P. Garcia on 15th of December 1960, Brgy Real was proclaimed as a municipality and parted from the Municipality of Infanta. Year 1968, Sitio Maragungdong has become a barangay and lately known as Barangay Maragondon Real, Quezon.<br><br>

The word Dumadagungdong, as hear-say, was the source by which the place was called Maragungdong because of the heavy rains, thunder and lightning every rainy season joined by rolling of huge rocks sounds trembling due to heavy flood and landslide on the edge of the river of Llavac.<br><br>

Year 1952 when the residents became united and elected Mr. Fermin Ortiz as their tinyente del barrio. Since then, a lot of changes happened as time pass by.</p>
