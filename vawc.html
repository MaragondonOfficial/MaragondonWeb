    <h1> BRGY MARAGONDON <span class="highlight">VAWC</span></h1>
    <p>VAWC stands for "Violence Against Women and their Children." It refers to any act or series of acts committed by any person against a woman who is his wife, former wife, or against a woman with whom he has or had a sexual or dating relationship, or with whom he has a common child. This includes physical, sexual, psychological harm, or economic abuse, and it encompasses various forms of violence such as threats, battery, and coercion. The issue of VAWC is addressed by laws such as the Anti-Violence Against Women and their Children Act of 2004 in the Philippines, which aims to protect women and children from such violence. <br><br>
